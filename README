The Tank Standard Project Configuration
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the Tank Standard config! It provides a starting point for 
experimentation and testing and will help you discover how Tank works!

Once you have installed the standard config for a project, you need to
do a quick configuration pass to make sure the config will work 
with your system. The main item to configure are the paths to the 
Maya and Nuke executables. These are needed in order for Tank to 
be able to launch Maya and Nuke from within Shotgun. These configuration 
options can be found in your newly created project:

- First navigate to the new project root folder.
- Now navigate to the tank folder and then to the config/env folder.
- Open the shotgun.yml file and edit the settings.  


Once things are set up, go to Shotgun:

1. Select some shots, right click and select Create Folders
3. Right click on a task for one of the shots and try launching Maya/Nuke
4. Once Maya or Nuke is launched, you should see a Tank menu appear
